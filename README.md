Below are the Key Stakeholders for the project - 
  Primary Stakeholder - Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing)
  Secondary Stakeholders - Cyclistic Marketing analytics team and Executive team

Data source used for doing the analysis - [Cyclistic trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)

Data is stored online on a S3 data store. Data is in the form of 12 different CSV files. One file with data for each month.

Data passess in the ROCCC test -
  It is Reliable & Original as the data is provided by the first party (where data was originated)
  It covers detailed trip data for the last 12 months including the location, date, time , customer type
  It is also the current (as it refer to the recent 12 months)
  It was not cited as the data was generated in house
  
It could not be proven that the data was unbiased as the data did not have more information on the participants (Age, Sex, Location, Physical Condition etc.)

So further analysis is done with the *Assumption* that the data generated was covering all participants without any specific bias.
